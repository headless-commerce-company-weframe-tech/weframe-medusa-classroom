# Project Overview: **Medusa Store Platform (Weframe Classroom Tasks)**

A mock project: **"Weframe Gear Shop"** ‚Äî an online store selling digital and physical products. Each task adds a new capability to the store, starting with foundational setup and leading to deeper customizations.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Module 1**

> Goal: Get familiar with Medusa‚Äôs setup and how to extend core features.

---

#### 1. **Project Setup**

- [ ] Setup Medusa project using [`create-medusa-app`](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/create-medusa-app). Do keep in mind that your db is not running locally, means you guys have to provide your db url with above create command.
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL and Redis
- [ ] Setup Medusa Admin Panel

#### 2. **Extend Core Modules**

- [ ] Extend **Cart** to support a custom discount rule (e.g. ‚ÄúBuy X Get Y‚Äù)
- [ ] Extend **Customer** to include additional fields like birthday or loyalty tier
- [ ] Extend **Product** to support custom metadata like license key type (for digital products)

### **‚öôÔ∏è Module 2**

> Goal: Understand how to create and use custom architectural modules.

---

#### 3. **Authentication**

- [ ] Create a **Custom Auth Provider** (e.g., magic link or social login)
- [ ] Handle **Password Reset Event** with custom email content

#### 4. **Cache & Event Handling**

- [ ] Create **Cache Module** to cache product availability checks
- [ ] Use **Cache Service** in a product availability controller
- [ ] Create **Event Module** to track custom events (e.g., wishlist added)
- [ ] Use **Event Service** to emit and listen to `wishlist.created` or `cart.abandoned` events

#### 5. **File Service**

- [ ] Use **File Module** to allow uploading product instruction PDFs or marketing images

### **‚öôÔ∏è Module 3**

> Goal: Learn how to integrate external systems and build real-world scalable workflows.

---

#### 6. **Fulfillment & Payment Providers**

- [ ] Create a **Custom Fulfillment Provider** for local courier delivery
- [ ] Create a **Custom Payment Provider** using a mock gateway (or Razorpay/Stripe if available)

#### 7. **Notification System**

- [ ] Create **Notification Provider** (e.g., Email via SendGrid, WhatsApp via Twilio)
- [ ] Use **Notification Service** in various flows (order confirmation, password reset)
- [ ] Trigger **Send Notification** on order completion

#### 8. **Workflow Engine**

- [ ] Use the **Workflow Engine** for an advanced flow:
  - Order placed ‚Üí Stock checked ‚Üí Payment captured ‚Üí Fulfillment started ‚Üí Notification sent

### **‚öôÔ∏è Module 4**

> These are ideal for those who also want to customize the Medusa Admin Panel.

---

#### 9. **Admin UI Customization**

- [ ] Learn about **Admin Components & Layouts**
- [ ] Create a new page in Admin for managing custom workflows or support tickets
- [ ] Add custom tab in product edit view for managing digital product metadata

### **‚öôÔ∏è Module 5**

> Expose your local development.

In this module, you‚Äôll learn how to expose your local Medusa server and Admin to reviewers using `ngrok`. You are **not required** to deploy to any cloud provider.

2. **Start Medusa Server and Admin Locally**

   - Run your Medusa backend and admin locally as usual.

3. **Install ngrok**

   - [Official ngrok install](https://ngrok.com/downloads/mac-os)

4. **Expose Your Local Server with ngrok**

   - Start ngrok on the port your Medusa backend is running (default: `9000`)

   ```bash
   ngrok http 9000
   ```

   - For Storefront you have to expose port 3000.

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

5. **Share the URLs**
   - Once ngrok provides you public URLs, share them with the review team.
   - Ensure that both the Medusa server and Admin are accessible.

## üìù Bonus Ideas

- Implement multi-vendor support with custom APIs
- Build a dashboard using the Notification & Event logs
- Add support for different sales channels (B2B, DTC)
- Integrate analytics by emitting events to a service like Segment or Plausible

# Code Submission Guidelines

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Ensure you have the latest version of the codebase by pulling the most recent changes:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   Create a new branch using the following naming convention:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b code.<your-github-username>
   ```

3. **Push Your Changes**

   - Make sure your code is clean, well-documented, and passes any existing checks or linters before submitting
   - After completing your development work, push your changes to your feature branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin code.<your-github-username>
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**

   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
   - Create a new pull request with `code` as the base branch.
   - Add a clear title and description summarizing your changes.

5. **Notify the Team**  
   Once your pull request is created, notify the team in the group chat for review and feedback.
